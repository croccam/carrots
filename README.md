# Description
This library is intended to make the process of building RabbitMQ architectures easier. It uses Pika client under the hood,
and helps to abstract some low-level requirements and reduce the boiler-plate code.
As a side effect, the flexibility of RabbitMQ is lost. I'm working on increasing the capabilities of carrots.
